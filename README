Building
--------

Development files for the following additional libraries are required:
* libnl3 (3.0)
* safec (3.3)
* readline (TODO: should be removed)
* hostap sources

Type `make` to build. The libnl3 and safec includes and libs are found through
pkg-config. If that doesn't provide the appropriate directories, they can be
specified with `libnl3_cflags`, `libnl3_libs`, `safec_cflags` and `safec_libs`.
readline must be present in the standard include paths, or else CFLAGS must be
set to point to its include directory. hostap sources are expected in
`../hostap`. Set `hostap_dir` if they are in a different directory.
